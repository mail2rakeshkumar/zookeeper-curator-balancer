Zookeeper and microservices-load-balancing
============================

How it works?

[Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/)  provides a central service for register, manage and discovery services  running on distributed machines.

Since ZooKeeper is a sub-project of Hadoop, the purpose of Zookeeper is cluster management, but you can use it, to implement different ["recipes and solutions"]( http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/recipes.html) that require  cluster management like locks, balancing, leader election and so forth.

We're going to use it for Load balancing microservices with a Netflix project called [Curator](https://github.com/Netflix/curator/wiki), Curator now is a Apache project, and this framework provides recipes of ZooKeeper and API's to register and discovery services in ZooKeeper.

###Simple Worker
Our distributed service will be different instances of `simple-worker` Spring Boot project. You can start one single instance in different machines by using the following command:

`java -jar simple-worker-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Worker_1 9001 --server.port=9001`

You can access the url of you worker with the url: `http://{host}:{port}/api/customer/list`.

###Simple Manager
Our simple manager service is waiting request on `/cl/api/customer/list`, note the 'cl' prefix in the url, is to differentiate our cluster, this service will delegate the request to the workers registered in ZooKeeper trough Curator Framework. This manager doesnâ€™t know anything about the workers register and you can test it, adding or removing 'simple-workers' instances.  You can run the simple manager by using the following command:

`java -jar simple-manager-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8001`


>Note: make sure you that before running any worker or the manager you already have [installed](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/zookeeperStarted.html#ch_GettingStarted) and running your ZooKeeper service in the 2181 port.

In your Spring Boot application you'll see logs like this:
